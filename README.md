Classification web app on toy datasets of sklearn

This web app is useful to run classical ML algorithms on toy datasets of sklearn without running any code. The application allows user to select a dataset, then the classifier and 
the model hyperparameters. The output shows the model accuracy, precision and recall. It can also plot confusion matrix, roc curve and precision-recall curve.

This web app is helpful for people new to classification algorithms and wish to visualize ML models and hyperparamter tuning without writing any code.
